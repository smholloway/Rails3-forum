Rails3-forum
============
A simple forum application written using Rails 3 
Seth Holloway (www.sethholloway.com)
A demo is available at http://rails3-forum.herokuapp.com/

This example differs from the Rails3-Forums-Without-Nesting project by using extra routes. This application has forums/id/topics/id and topics/id, while the 'without-nesting' example had only forums/id/topics/id.

What it does
------------
This forum application contains forums, conversations, and comments. Forums are high-level topics; conversations are threads within a specific forum and comments create the conversation.

Getting it run
--------------
Clone the git repository
* git clone https://github.com/smholloway/Rails3-forum.git
Change directories to the application
* cd Rails3-forum
Create the database
* rake db:migrate
Start the server
* rails server

Limitations
-----------
* There is no authentication or authorization.
* There is no error checking
* The code has not been thoroughly tested.
* Lacking style and JavaScript goodness.
* No fancy nesting or @replies like those provided by Disqus or other modern commenting systems.
